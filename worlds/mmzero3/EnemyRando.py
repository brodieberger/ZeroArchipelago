"""Enemy randomization. Only done when the option for it is enabled.

This file here does several things.
  1. Swap the sprite sheets. The enemies that have replaced the fewest so far this seed are tried first, 
     so the same few smaller enemies are not placed everywhere.
  2. Merge palette slots so that enemies can share them.
  3. Account for Extra enemies and load them into stages that didn't usually have them.
  4. Check per spawn location and decide what should go there.

You should probably read through EnemyData.py to understand a lot of this. It uses variable names pulled from the
decomp that I tend to rename myself if I find them too strange. Sorry that can cause confusion in a lot of areas.

The stage's table is organized by rows. Each row contains information saying to load a sprite sheet into tiles in video memory,
load a color palette for those tiles, in specific level areas, and in specific modes (normal, mettaur, cyber, and mettaur+cyber)

These stage rows will be changed along with the spawn points, since they are needed to actually render the enemies.

I also use these names interchangably by mistake, but for the enemy spawning:
   
    spawn point: The one single location where vanilla places an enemy. Used as a base for the randomizer spawn spots.
    
    spawn spot: Multiple of these per spawn point. Can be placed on the ground, a little in the air,
    embedded in the ground, on a nearby wall, or nearby ceiling, or a hand placed spot in specific enemies. 
    These are where the randomizer actually puts enemies. Each enemy uses one specific spawn spot based on its spawn requirements.
